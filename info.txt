JSON and a server
=================
This project must run on a server (local server) to use and access the data from the JSON file 

This can be achieved by:
1. Running the project from VS code using Live Server (install the Live Server Extension), or
- the URL will look something like this: 
    "127.0.0.1:5501/index.html"

2. Using a python module (Python has to be installed)
- in cmd, Windows, run the following command "python -m http.server"
(this will create a localserver)
- then go to your browser, and type "localhost:8000"
- finally navigate the file that needs to be opened (eg. index.html)
- the URL will look something like this: 
    "localhost:8000/index.html"
